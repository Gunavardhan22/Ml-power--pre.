## Introduction

Accurate energy consumption prediction is crucial for efficient resource management, grid stability, and cost optimization. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze historical energy consumption patterns and predict future demand.  We explore various models and feature engineering techniques to achieve high prediction accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is [Describe the dataset here.  Include details like:
    * Source of the data (e.g., publicly available, collected from sensors, etc.)
    * Size of the dataset (number of data points, time range)
    * Features included (e.g., time of day, day of week, weather data, temperature, humidity, etc.)
    * Target variable (energy consumption)]

You can download the dataset from [Link to the dataset if publicly available, or instructions on how to obtain it].  The data should be placed in the `data/` directory.

## Methodology

The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for model training. This may include handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.  (e.g., creating time-based features like hour of day, day of week, month, or lagged variables of energy consumption).
3. **Model Selection:** Training and comparing different machine learning models, such as:
    * [List the models you used, e.g., Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), LSTM networks (if using time series data)]
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics. [Mention the metrics used, e.g. Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared].
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing the model parameters to achieve the best possible performance. [Mention any techniques used for tuning, such as Grid Search, Randomized Search, Bayesian Optimization].
6. **Prediction:** Using the best trained model to predict future energy consumption.
